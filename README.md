# 2020-COMP3016-CW1 File Reader for Console

For this assessment you are to write a FileReader able to load and inspect Collada DAE Files.
The project provides a header file with all the procedure declarations and a dummy FileReader.cpp with stubbed implementations and comments which mention which peices of code to complete. You are not to add any further libraries to help you solve this problem.

Your task is it to fill the stubs and create a working file reader able to complete the given and further tests.
To complete the project upto a good grade, you are to create a reader that can open any of the three files and identify and retrieve the lines which define specific nodes, subnodes and attributes. The format of the DAE is XML Syntax. 

### Code of conduct
All stubbed methods must be implmented as there will be multiple tests checking them. If you hard-code an answer to pass the tests, the test will be retroactively treated as failed. 

**Do not change either the tests.h, doctest.h, the make file or the FileReader.h file as well as modify the project file as it will invalidate your submission**

### About the testing/marking process
The submission initally has a small set of tests to check functionality.
Further tests will be uploaded to allow you to develop and test against them.

__A final set of tests where only the test parameters are changed will be used for marking to stop hard-coding answers.__
